# PrinterListRemove_PShost

This is a sorta useful unfinished project used for an office with issues with printers. It's simply a C# wrapper to powershell commands.
It pulls printers seen by a windows installation and lets you kick the drivers at a low level. Useful for L1 techs to remove hidden printers/drivers that can cause issues.
